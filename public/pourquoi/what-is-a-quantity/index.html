    The question
    
    
</h2><blockquote>
<p><em>someone at Meta:</em>
<strong>I never get why area is length times width.</strong></p>
<p>Times here means multiplication. If you take a length of 3 cm and multiply it by width of 2 cm, you are adding 3cm twice, which get you 6 cm. Why is that the &lsquo;area&rsquo;? Actually, what does &lsquo;area&rsquo; even mean? Of course I understand that you have to multiply the units too, so it&rsquo;s actually 6 cm squared. But cm squared as a concept is even more baffling.</p>
<p>Someon explain to me like I am five the idea of area and why it&rsquo;s length times width.</p>

</h2><p>Mary the skillful painter that paint all the walls of the villagers with constant thickness. (an arbitrary unit for area)
Jane her also-skillful daughter that paint twice as thick to prevent degradation by rain. (unit conversion)
Elizabeth the tiler. (an other arbitrary unit for area in a different context)
Lydia the hermit that think tilers and painters could use the same unit. (unifying areas and the idea of squared length)</p>

</h2><p>Length as a unit of area (1 m is the area of a circle of radius 1 m)
Time as a unit of length (c=1)
Unit as nothing inherently meaningful but only useful for <em>physical intuition</em></p>
<h2 id="quantities-values-and-units">
    Quantities, values and units
    
    
</h2><p>A quantity is a value and a unit.
A value is something that can be compared.
Canonically a value is a number as number are by definition the abstract concept of comparaison. (whole numbers, rational numbers etc&hellip;)
A unit is just something we need so we don&rsquo;t count the weigth of a potate and of planets with comensurable numbers because it would be impractical.</p>
