title: What is a physical quantity
summary: I never get why area is length times width.

## The question

> **I never get why area is length times width.**

> Times here means multiplication. If you take a length of 3 cm and multiply it by width of 2 cm, you are adding 3cm twice, which get you 6 cm. Why is that the 'area'? Actually, what does 'area' even mean? Of course I understand that you have to multiply the units too, so it's actually 6 cm squared. But cm squared as a concept is even more baffling.

## A small village

Mary the skillful painter that paint all the walls of the villagers with constant thickness. (an arbitrary unit for area)
Jane her also-skillful daughter that paint twice as thick to prevent degradation by rain. (unit conversion)
Elizabeth the tiler. (an other arbitrary unit for area in a different context)
Lydia the hermit that think tilers and painters could use the same unit. (unifying areas and the idea of squared length)

## Units are arbitrary

Length as a unit of area (1 m is the area of a circle of radius 1 m)
Time as a unit of length (c=1)
Unit as nothing inherently meaningful but only useful for *physical intuition*

## Quantities, values and units

A quantity is a value and a unit.
A value is something that can be compared. 
Canonically a value is a number as number are by definition the abstract concept of comparaison. (whole numbers, rational numbers etc...)
A unit is just something we need so we don't count the weigth of a potate and of planets with comensurable numbers because it would be impractical.
